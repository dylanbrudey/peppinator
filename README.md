# peppinator
Akinator-like guessing game on the web.

The program tries to ask the least possible amount of questions to the user in order to guess as fast as it can which movie or tv show the latter is thinking about.
If the suggested guess is wrong, the user can choose to keep on playing the game until the next guess, play another game or stop playing altogether.
